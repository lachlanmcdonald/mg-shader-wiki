> **Volume Shaders** are shaders that apply to your entire volume.

How to use a Brush Shader

1. Select the shader in the **Shader List**
2. Adjust the arguments and press the **Execute Shader** button
3. If you want to adjust the results, **undo**, adjust and re-execute 

Some shaders, like [Pyramid](pyramid/) and [Sand](sand/), add voxels layer-by-later; so you should execute these as many times as you like until the desired effect is attained.
